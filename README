This is a playbook to install an all-in-one beaker server & lab controller for use with DCI.

Before applying it the following files need some configuration:

• `inventory`: adjust the hostname and user of the machine to use as a beaker server

• `group_vars/all`: adjust the values for admin user and lab setup (DHCP range, systems access)


Apply with:

    ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml


Before ansible 2.5.6, skip the firewall tag due to an issue with the `service_facts` module :

    ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml --skip-tags=firewall


After running the playbook the first time, the credentials for services on the beaker server will be stored in the `credentials/` folder, unless the variables ared hardcoded in `group_vars/all`
